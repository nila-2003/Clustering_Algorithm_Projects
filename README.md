# Projects (Using Clustering)
1. Customer Segmentation

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers

Algorithm Used: K-Means
Static Code has been used to find the precise value for k. The optimal value of K found was 5.
Plotting the scatter plot, it was found that the "Blue" colored cluster were the target audience for the company.

Method used: kmeans.inertia_

2. Brain MRI Image Segmentation

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

The image clustering was done using k-means algorithm where the k-value was found to be 2 by the elbow method.
